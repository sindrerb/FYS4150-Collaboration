\section{Introduction} {
    The project consists of two main parts; solving the Shroedinger's equation (SE) for one and two particles in a three dimensional harmonic oscillator(HO) well with and without Coulomb interactions.
    Shroedinger's equation is solved by Jacobi's method, by rewriting it in a discretized form, as an eigenvalue equation.

\section{Method} {

    \subsection{Schr√∂dinger's equation} {
        SE is often written on the form
            \begin{align*}
                -\dfrac{\hbar^2 \nabla^2}{2m}\psi(x) + V(x)\psi(x) = E(x)\psi(x)
            \end{align*}
        First off we take a look at how we can rewrite the SL for one electron placed in a three dimensional HO-potential with Coulomb interactions. By assuming spherical symmetry and only looking at the radial part the SL look like this
            \begin{align*}
                  -\dfrac{\hbar^2}{2 m} \left ( \dfrac{1}{r^2} \dfrac{d}{dr} r^2 \frac{d}{dr} - \dfrac{l (l + 1)}{r^2} \right )R(r) + V(r) R(r) = E R(r).
            \end{align*}
        Where the potential $V(r)$ is known by the HO-potential $\frac{1}{2}kr^2$, with $k=m\omega^2$ and the quantum number $l$ describe the orbital momentum of the electron.
        The energies and oscillator frequency is given by
            \begin{align*}
                E_{nl} = \hbar\omega\left(2n+l+ \dfrac{3}{2} \right)
            \end{align*}
        where $n\in \mathbb N$, $l\in \mathbb N$ and $r \in [0,\infty)$. By rewriting $R(r)$ as $rR(r) = u(r)$ we get
            \begin{align*}
                -\dfrac{\hbar^2}{2 m} \frac{d^2}{dr^2} u(r) + \left ( V(r) + \dfrac{l (l + 1)}{r^2}\dfrac{\hbar^2}{2 m} \right ) u(r)  = E u(r)
            \end{align*}
        The expression can be further simplified by introducing the dimensionless variable $\rho = \frac{1}{\alpha}r$, setting $V(\rho) = \frac{1}{2}k\alpha^2\rho^2$, multiply with $\frac{2m\alpha^2}{\hbar^2}$ and set $l=0$ so that
            \begin{align*}
                -\frac{d^2}{d\rho^2} u(\rho) +\underbrace{ \frac{mk}{\hbar^2} \alpha^4}_{I}\rho^2u(\rho)  = \underbrace{\frac{2m\alpha^2}{\hbar^2}E}_{II}u(\rho)
            \end{align*}
        and finally setting I $=1$ and defining II $=\lambda$ the final form of the SL for one electron in a HO-potential can be written as
            \begin{align}
                -\frac{d^2}{d\rho^2} u(\rho) + \rho^2u(\rho)  = \lambda u(\rho)
            \end{align}
        
    }

#Project 2
This folder contains all material used to create the report in the 'report' folder.
All data is extracted form 'jacobiansolver' in the 'build' folder and plottet with python.

###Jacobiansolver
The program takes input from terminal where<br>
[1] Number N iterations (400 gives a relative good accuaracy)<br>
[2] Harmonic oscillator frequency, leave 0 for single particle calculations<br>
[3] Max rho, a higher maximum rho is required for low frequencies (maxRho=50,freq.=0.01, maxRho=3,freq.=5)<br>
[4] Use columb interactions (Boolean where input is 1=true and 0=false)<br>
[5] Write unit test output (Input is a integer, writes output each full multiplum of input, leave 0 for no unit test)<br>

### Unit test
The unit test is chosen solved in the python program 'unitTest.py' by input from the jaciobian solver.

# Project 3

This project repository contains a simulator of the solar system, is it written in a way that solves any system where the gravitational force is dominating and where the initial positions and velocities are known. The simulator asks for a set of input arguments with suggestions before simulating.

### Inputfiles
The inputfile is based on lines where the first argument on the line is the name of the celestial body, the second argument is a double precision float representing the mass of the celestial body, then three values are given representing the initial coordinate in (x,y,z), and three values representing the initial velocity (vx,vy,vz).
The outputfile will correspond to the inputfile with 'OUT' at the end, if multiple calculations are made it is important to rename your outputfile before running the next calculation since the file will be overwritten.
